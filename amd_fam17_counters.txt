Floating Point (FP) Events
PMCx000 [FPU Pipe Assignment] (FpuPipeAssignment)
The number of operations (uOps) and dual-pipe uOps dispatched to each of the 4 FPU execution pipelines. This
event reflects how busy the FPU pipelines are and may be used for workload characterization. This includes all
operations performed by x87, MMXTM, and SSE instructions, including moves. Each increment represents a one-
cycle dispatch event. This event is a speculative event. Since
this event includes non-numeric operations it is not suitable for measuring MFLOPS.
